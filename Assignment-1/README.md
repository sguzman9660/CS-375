I chose the Shadertoy website that was linked on the assignment page. When you open the page, it shows a few of the shaders. Hovering over one plays it, and if you click on it, it takes you to a page where it also shows the code for it. I thought this was really cool. Here is the Link: [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
